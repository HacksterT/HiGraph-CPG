what is the best therapy if my patient has diabetes with diabetic nephropathy

Based on the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline recommendations, here's the evidence-based approach for treating diabetes with diabetic nephropathy:

Primary recommendation: For adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, Recommendation 022 provides Strong guidance For using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors with proven renal protection to improve renal outcomes. This is the first-line choice when patients are good candidates for this medication class.

Alternative option: If your patient is not a good candidate for SGLT-2 inhibitors, Recommendation 023 offers Strong guidance For using glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists with proven renal protection to improve macroalbuminuria. This serves as an excellent alternative with strong evidence for renal benefits.

Additional consideration: Even if your patient has already achieved their individualized glycemic targets, Recommendation 024 provides Weak guidance For considering the addition of an SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist, given the cardiovascular and renal protective benefits beyond glucose control in patients with renal disease.

The key is selecting agents within these classes that have proven renal protection in clinical trials, prioritizing SGLT-2 inhibitors first, then GLP-1 receptor agonists if SGLT-2 inhibitors are contraindicated or not tolerated.
